variable "gcp_project_id" {
  type = string

The ID of the project in which the resources belong.
EOF

variable "cluster_name" {
  type = string

  description = <<EOF
The name of the cluster, unique within the project and zone.
EOF
}

variable "gcp_location" {
  type = string

  description = <<EOF
The location (region or zone) in which the cluster master will be created,
as well as the default node location. If you specify a zone (such as
us-central1-a), the cluster will be a zonal cluster with a single cluster
master. If you specify a region (such as us-west1), the cluster will be a
regional cluster with multiple masters spread across zones in that region.
Node pools will also be created as regional or zonal, to match the cluster.
If a node pool is zonal it will have the specified number of nodes in that
zone. If a node pool is regional it will have the specified number of nodes
in each zone within that region. For more information see: 
https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/regional-clusters

The list of node pool configurations, each should include:

name - The name of the node pool, which will be suffixed with '-pool'.
Defaults to pool number in the Terraform list, starting from 1.

initial_node_count - The initial node count for the pool. Changing this will
force recreation of the resource. Defaults to 1.

autoscaling_min_node_count - Minimum number of nodes in the NodePool. Must be
>=0 and <= max_node_count. Defaults to 2.

autoscaling_max_node_count - Maximum number of nodes in the NodePool. Must be
>= min_node_count. Defaults to 3.

management_auto_repair - Whether the nodes will be automatically repaired.
Defaults to 'true'.

management_auto_upgrade - Whether the nodes will be automatically upgraded.
Defaults to 'true'.

node_config_machine_type - The name of a Google Compute Engine machine type.
Defaults to n1-standard-1. To create a custom machine type, value should be
set as specified here:
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/instances#machineType

node_config_disk_type - Type of the disk attached to each node (e.g.
'pd-standard' or 'pd-ssd'). Defaults to 'pd-standard'

node_config_disk_size_gb - Size of the disk attached to each node, specified
in GB. The smallest allowed disk size is 10GB. Defaults to 100GB.

node_config_preemptible - Whether or not the underlying node VMs are
preemptible. See the official documentation for more information. Defaults to
false. https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/preemptible-vms
